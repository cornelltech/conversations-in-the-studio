# Conversations in the Studio

This event features a montly guest practitioner for a provocative, closed-door discussion with students. The guest practitioners are active entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, social entrepreneurs, engineers, designers, artists, VCs, lawyers, writers, ethicists, and other diverse leaders who are impacting society through their entrepreneurial efforts.

Conversations take place in the Cornell Tech Studio, and are moderated by an assigned group of students and one Cornell Tech alum that come prepared with questions and discussion topics. This is not a lecture: it's a weekly wake-up call.

## Schedule for Fall 2017

The event is held at Cornell Tech in the Studio on Thursdays from 6:15p to 7:30p unless otherwise noted.

* 9/21 – **Denise Young Smith**, Vice President, Inclusion and Diversity at Apple
* 10/5 – **Jason Goldman**, former Chief Digital Officer at the White House
* 10/19 – **Alison Elizabeth Taylor**, Artist
* 11/30 – **Fred Wilson**, Managing Partner at Union Square Ventures

## Objectives

*	To broadly expose students to varying forms of impact, from commercial success to societal good, from engineering to art, from the pure tech sector to the digital economy transforming all sectors, from startups to growth opportunities on and at any stage.

*	To help students understand the value and means of impact. This topic can be understood commercially, societally, and personally.

*	To help students develop personal models of impact that will motivate and aid their own entrepreneurial lives after graduation.

*	To give students first-hand contact with entrepreneurial individuals that can serve as role models and connectors.

*	To give students experience having thoughtful conversations with diverse leaders.

## Student Responsibilities

*	Each Conversation, an assigned group of students and one Cornell Tech alum is responsible for moderating the group conversation. This includes researching the guest beforehand, [preparing the audience](https://github.com/cornelltech/conversations-in-the-studio/wiki/Prep), [preparing questions](https://github.com/cornelltech/conversations-in-the-studio/wiki/Questions), and [leading the conversation](https://github.com/cornelltech/conversations-in-the-studio/wiki/Moderation).

*	Students must proactively engage the guests and each other, asking attentive questions and making follow-up comments.

* Whenever a student speaks for the first time in a given week, they should tell the guest their name, degree, and one thing about themselves.

* Students asking questions from the audience should stand up when called upon.

*	At the end of each Conversation, both the moderating students and several students in the audience volunteer or are called upon to share their personal takeaways in front of the guest.

* This is a closed-door event: students can tweet (or otherwise mention on social media) general information about a guest's Conversation but cannot quote the guest or share any specific information.

* Laptop and cell phone use are prohibited during the Conversation (journal use is permitted).

* Students cannot invite guests to Conversations: these are closed-door sessions for current students only.

* Respect the guest's time commitment and do not be late to the event.
