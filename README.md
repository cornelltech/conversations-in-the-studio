## Course Objectives

* To help students understand the value of entrepreneurialism, what it takes to be entrepreneurial, and how to achieve real-world impact. These topics can be understood commercially, societally, and personally.

* To broadly expose students to varying forms and means of real-world, entrepreneurial impact, from commercial success to societal good, from computer science to inter-disciplines, from the pure tech sector to the information economy transforming all sectors, from startups to growth opportunities on and at any stage.

* To give students first-hand contact with entrepreneurial individuals that can serve as role models and connectors.

* To help students develop personal models of entrepreneurialism that will motivate and aid their own entrepreneurial efforts after graduation.

## Student Responsibilities

* Students should spend a little time preparing for each practicum by reading about the guests and thinking of a few questions to ask.

* Students must proactively engage the guests and each other, asking attentive questions and making followup comments.

* At the end of each practicum, one or two students are called upon to note their key takeaways from that practicum.

* In the final practicum, many students are called upon to present their key takeaways from the entire series of practicums, to be discussed as a group and with the guests.
